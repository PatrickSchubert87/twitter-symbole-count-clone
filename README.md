## Third Approach

The third approache uses: 

- an IIFE function
- This approach uses only one eventListeners with one function call
- The events are called with a froEach Array methode
- This is a better approach because now it's DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and uses only one function
- Also this approach uses a slice methode to exclude characters after maxLength is reached
